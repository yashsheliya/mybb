# Fluid Task Teams

##  Proposal
Deemphasize staff Teams by converting them to more fluid *Task Teams* with *Leaders* and allowing members to hold more than one label.

During the transition period and for compatibility reasons (MyBB's *Credits*) *Primary Groups*  will be initially non-removable and members from _Subgroups_ will be assigned to them.

Proposed initial Task Groups:

- **Management** (MAN) (Primary Group)

  Legal owners and Project Manager

- **Development** (DEV) (Primary Group)

  Product development

- **Design** (DES) (Development Subgroup)

  Design development

- **Security** (SEC) (Development Subgroup)

  Security issues

- **Devops** (OPS) (Primary Group) (formerly *Quality Assurance*)

  Repository maintenance, release engineering

- **Web** (WEB) (Devops Subgroup)

  Web platforms maintenance

- **Support** (SUP) (Primary Group)

  Product support

- **Community** (COM) (Primary Group)

  Public Relations, Community curation

- **Editorial** (EDI) (Community Subgroup)

  Content of *MyBB.com* websites, Documentation and Blog


## Justification
- Visualize overlapping activities independent of specific Team membership
- Transparently document responsibilities
- Adapt to changing activity areas faster

## Effects & Implications

- the *MyBB.com* staff page will include Task Team listing and descriptions
- the *MyBB.com* staff page will include links to specific personal entries
- Community Forums staff profiles will link to personal *MyBB.com* staff page entries, listing assigned teams
- the Task Teams and membership might be pulled from the staff page to be displayed in profiles and posts
- the GitHub organization will only include teams relevant to the development process

# Official Communication Style

## Abstract
The communication between MyBB staff members and the Community includes both official statements/responses and personal opinions that should not be associated with views represented by the MyBB Group. Currently the distinction between these types of content is provided only by the presence of formal style (i.e. salutation, closing), however it is not enforced and does not clearly indicate the sender of the message.

## Proposal
While there is no need to overuse the formal style (we are mostly dealing with technical issues that need to be resolved relatively fast), messages representing the official position of MyBB Group should:

- be signed as _MyBB Team_, optionally including the author's full name or username (_Regards, MyBB Team_; Thanks for your submission, _Alice D. (MyBB Team)_, etc.),
- not contain subjective views, unless clearly stated,
- not include information not available publicly, unless discussed previously,
- respect voluntary reports (e.g. by using _Thanks_ as complimentary closing, providing implementation estimates [if possible and suitable], etc.),

Official messages include opening/closing responses to inquiries addressed to MyBB Team or its subdivisions, opening messages regarding Extend submissions and those intended as official statements related to MyBB.
If the issue has been addressed to the MyBB Team or part of it rather than specific member (extended technical questions/discussions, etc.), the Official Communication Style should be followed.

## Effects & Implications
MyBB Team members should follow the Official Communication Style in the circumstances described.
These rules should be included in a final summary _Documetation_ thread along with other directives on Team members' roles and behavior.

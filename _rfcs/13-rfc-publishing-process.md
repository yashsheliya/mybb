# RFC publishing process

##  Proposal
Initiate the process of publishing RFC documents and related metadata:

- First draft date,
- Author(s),
- Status,
- Voting start date,
- Voting end date,
- Quorum,
- Voting results for each option

after the voting phase.

## Justification
See RFC _Documentation and transparency standards_.

## Effects & Implications
- Existing RFC documents will be published on the MyBB website with the exception of those marked as restricted marked in the RFC attachment \#1.
- Future RFC documents will be published on the MyBB website unless explicitly stated in the document before the voting process.

# MyBB RFC Process

## Proposal
The RFC proposes to adopt the following document as our official internal RFC process:

https://github.com/mybb/meta-internal/blob/master/docs/rfc-process.md

The process as written may be amended in future RFCs.
The process as written must be followed for all future RFCs.

The voting options for this RFC shall be: accept, reject, abstain.

## Justification
- We currently struggle to reach clear consensus on issues.
- We do not have good documentation for the decisions we have made that will stand up to community scrutiny.
- It is currently difficult to engage enough of the staff in making decisions to make a decision that a majority agree with.

## Actions
- All Staff - submit or call for RFCs where appropriate.
- All Staff - regularly contribute to RFC discussions.
- All Staff - vote on RFCs in good time.
- All Staff - adhere to the RFC process.
- All Staff - carry out any actions assigned to them as a result of an RFC.

## Effects & Implications
If RFC votes do not meet quorum, we will have to address that fact and it will inevitably result in staff members who are not active being removed.

# MyBB 2.0 Alpha 1 Feature Freeze

## Proposal
This RFC proposes to officially place MyBB 2.0 Alpha 1 in feature freeze according to the issue list in the Alpha 1 milestone on GitHub:

https://github.com/mybb/mybb2/issues?q=i...Alpha+1%22

Screenshot: http://i.imgur.com/24EYilh.png

In accordance with the feature freeze, the following will now apply to the Alpha 1 milestone on GitHub:

- No further issues that are 'new-feature' or 'feature-enhancement' may be added to the Alpha 1 milestone unless prescribed by a passing RFC.
- No 'new-feature' or 'feature-enhancement' issues may be removed from the Alpha 1 milestone unless prescribed by a passing RFC.

This RFC also proposes that Alpha 1 may not be released until all of the issues in that screenshot are completed to the satisfaction of the QA team and/or Lead Developer.

## Effects & Implications
There may be features that the community feel should be in Alpha 1 that aren't. This can be handled through good communication that Alpha 1 does not represent a finite feature set for 2.0

## Justification
We want to ship Alpha 1 this year, in order to do that there needs to be a clear endpoint, a finite set of features that we commit to deliver before we ship Alpha 1.

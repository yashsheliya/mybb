			Years ago, Chris Boulton, web34rk, and b0ndman were on a team developing the XMB forum software. After some time, web34rk and b0ndman left the team and Chris became lead developer of a team with two other developers. Over time, staff shifted again and several developers didn't like the way things were heading and left the team, together forking the project as DevBB. &nbsp;DevBB was the predecessor to MyBB, a temporary solution for people to use whilst MyBB, at the time MyBulletinBoard, was being developed from scratch.</p>
		<p>
			MyBB 1.0 was released to the public on December 9, 2005 after several years of steady development and testing. In the years since, MyBB has undergone active development, further extending MyBB's capabilities through new features and the capabilities of third-party developers with improved plugin support. Over 60 versions of MyBB have been released since 1.0, ever improving MyBB's status in the forum software industry. Today, MyBB is a mature forum software with a wide range of useful <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/#features">features</a>.</p>

As an open source project, the MyBB Team is pushing to open up its development process as much as possible to make it easier for community members to <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/get-involved/">get involved</a> with the project. Community members actively contributing to the MyBB project are recruited to join the team in an official capacity.</p>

# MyBB Project-managed Web Presence
_Includes the Community Forums and MyBB.com websites_

You can reach the MyBB Team by creating a private thread, visible only to you and staff members, in the [**Private Inquiries**](https://community.mybb.com/forum-135.html) section on the Community Forums.
Alternatively, administrators can be reached via e-mail:  `contact@mybb.com`.

- #### Discord channels
  You can reach online MyBB Team members by sending them a Message. Discord also allows you to [block certain users](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/217916488-Blocking-Privacy-Settings-).


- #### GitHub code repositories
  It is also possible to report problematic behavior [directly to GitHub](https://github.com/contact/report-abuse).


# Forums Powered by MyBB

While the MyBB Project creates and maintains software that powers numerous discussion boards, it does not have the tools to control, modify or block specific MyBB forums.

If you suspect a website or forum is involved in illegal activities, you can use the [WHOIS Search tool](https://whois.icann.org/en/) to find out:
 - which company keeps a specific **domain** online (_Registrar_ fields in the report),
 - which company **hosts** the website/forum in question on their servers (_Names Servers_  fields in the report).

Contacts to given companies, if not shown explicitly, can be found using a search engine ([DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/), [Google](https://google.com/), [Bing](https://www.bing.com/)) by searching for `[company name] abuse` or `[company name] contact`.

You can also contact law enforcement relevant to you or the offending website. Selected resources:
- [Europol &mdash; Report Cybercrime Online](https://www.europol.europa.eu/report-a-crime/report-cybercrime-online) (European Union)
- [Department of Justice &mdash; Reporting Computer, Internet-related, Or Intellectual Property Crime](https://www.justice.gov/criminal-ccips/reporting-computer-internet-related-or-intellectual-property-crime) (United States)

Administrators of forums that do not meet our [Support Eligibility](https://mybb.com/support/eligibility-policy/) criteria may be denied official technical support.

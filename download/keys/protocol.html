Team members of at least 90 days, familiar with PGP basics and related safety practices, who own a Team Member Key are permitted to participate in the MyBB Signing Key process. The eligibility is assessed in internal interviews conducted by [Security Role](https://mybb.com/about/team/#role-security) members.

The Protocol allows to mitigate the following risks related to end user packages:
 - forged or modified packages by third parties after gaining control of MyBB-managed platforms or intercepting requests from end users,
 - legitimate packages swapped with ones containing unauthorized modifications as a result of a man-in-the-middle attack or checksum collision attack.

# Definitions

- **Team Member Keys**

  Personal keys owned by Team members and listed on the official [About the Team](https://mybb.com/about/team/) page.

- **MyBB Signing Keys**

  Official keys used to sign software packages.

  Each active MyBB Signing Key, at any given time:
  - is signed with the owner's current Team Member Key,
  - has the owner's current Team Member Key set as a designated revoker,
  - is signed by at least one Role Leader, other than the owner, with their current Team Member Key (authorization),
  - has at least one Role Leader's current Team Member Key, other than the owner's, set as a designated revoker.

  The Keys are updated with new, valid values when authorization/revocation continuity is broken (e.g. as a result of personnel changes).

- **Announcement Channels**

  Reputable third-party recordkeeping solutions allowing to independently establish dates of protocol events:

  - [`@mybbsecurity` Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/mybbsecurity), maintained by Team members handling security issues.

- **Archiving Services**

  Reputable third-party archiving services providing snapshots of MyBB Signing Key listings:

  - [web.archive.org](https://web.archive.org/)

# Software Setup

[GnuPG](https://www.gnupg.org/) is used for key and signature management &mdash; it is recommended to use version 2.1 or higher.

Before following any step of the Protocol, the GnuPG configuration file (`~/.gnupg/gpg.conf` &mdash; the location can be checked with `gpg --version`) should be updated to prioritize strong algorithms:
```
personal-digest-preferences SHA512
cert-digest-algo SHA512
default-preference-list SHA512 SHA384 SHA256 SHA224 AES256 AES192 AES CAST5 ZLIB BZIP2 ZIP Uncompressed
```

# Key Management

#### Creating MyBB Signing Keys
1. Create a 4096-bit _RSA (sign only)_ key with _Real name_ set to your Community Forums name, _Email address_ to your `*@mybb.com` e-mail address, and _Comment_ to `CODE SIGNING KEY`. These details must match exactly.

   ```
   gpg --full-gen-key
   ```

   (`gpg --gen-key` on older versions)

2. Sign the created key with your Team Member Key.

   ```
   gpg -u TEAM-MEMBER-KEY-ID --sign-key MYBB-KEY-ID
   ```

3. Add [designated revokers](#definitions) (their public keys need to present in the keyring).

   ```
   gpg --edit-key MYBB-KEY-ID
   ```
   ```
   > addrevoker
   ```

    Provide the revoker's Team Member Key fingerprint when prompted and save:

   ```
   > save
   ```

4. Export the signed public key with metadata:

   ```
   (gpg --fingerprint --list-sigs MYBB-KEY-ID && gpg --armor --export MYBB-KEY-ID) > MYBB-KEY-ID.TEAM-MEMBER-KEY-ID.asc
   ```

   and post it internally for further processing.

#### Adding MyBB Signing Keys
1. Verify the key's correctness (e.g. using [pgpdump](https://www.mew.org/~kazu/proj/pgpdump/en/)) and that it's correctly signed and contains necessary [designated revokers](#definitions).
1. Have the key signed according to _MyBB Signing Keys_.

   ```
   gpg -u TEAM-MEMBER-KEY-ID --sign-key MYBB-KEY-ID
   ```

2. Add the key block with included signatures to [mybb.com/download/keys/](https://mybb.com/download/keys/), denoting key owner's username, full key fingerprint and date.
3. Trigger Archiving Services to save the new version of the MyBB Signing Keys listing and the key's details page.
4. Announce the addition on Announcement Channels in the following format, denoting the full fingerprint:

   ```
   Adding MyBB Signing Key FEED DEAF ABBA BEAD BABE FACE DEAD BEEF CEDE CAFE.
   ```

The key can be used to sign packages after 14 days have passed since it was added to the website and announced on Announcement Channels.

#### Removing MyBB Signing Keys
1. Have the key revoked as a [designated revoker](#definitions) and import the revocation certificate into `gpg`.

   ```
   gpg --desig-revoke MYBB-KEY-ID | gpg --import
   ```

2. Export the revoked key with associated data:

   ```
   (gpg --fingerprint --list-sigs MYBB-KEY-ID && gpg --armor --export MYBB-KEY-ID) > MYBB-KEY-ID.revoked.asc
   ```

4. Update the key block on the [mybb.com/download/keys/](https://mybb.com/download/keys/) list to contain the revoked signature, denoting the removal date.
3. Trigger Archiving Services to save the new version of the MyBB Signing Keys listing and the key's details page.
4. Announce the removal on Announcement Channels in the following format, denoting the full fingerprint:

   ```
   Removing MyBB Signing Key FEED DEAF ABBA BEAD BABE FACE DEAD BEEF CEDE CAFE.
   ```

# Package Signing

1. #### Individual signing
   If any issues have been found, do not proceed and report them internally.

   1. Check for alerts, announcements and notices related to Project's security and the current release process &mdash; do not proceed unless release-related issues have been resolved.
   2. Build the package(s) from the source using supplied patches and metadata.
   3. Assure that the internal candidate package(s) and the one(s) generated are identical (full file content comparison).
   4. Check Announcement Channels for announcements related to your signing key.
   5. Make a detached signature of the package(s) using a valid MyBB Signing Key with SHA-512 as the digest algorithm:

      ```
      gpg -u MYBB-KEY-ID --armor --output package.zip.asc --digest-algo sha512 --no-version --detach-sign package.zip
      ```

      and post it internally.

2. #### Release
   1. #### Signature verification
      Provided signatures are verified to assure correctness.
   2. #### Signature publication
       All signatures are distributed with the package(s). Whenever signatures are added, removed or updated, Archiving Services are triggered to save the new version of the package(s) signature listing.

		</header>
		<p>MyBB is licensed under the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/licenses/gpl/">LGPL</a> and therefore users may remove the MyBB copyright and credit notice from the footer of their forum, however those who choose to do so are ineligible for support on our platforms.</p>
		<p>To receive support users must display a <em>powered by</em> notice on every page of their forum:</p>
		<blockquote>
			Powered by <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://mybb.com">MyBB</a>.
		</blockquote>
		<p>The text can be rephrased in a non-derogatory way, can be presented using images and equivalent forms and must link to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://mybb.com">https://mybb.com</a>.</p>
		<p>If your theme does not already carry the <i>powered by</i> message it can be added by going to <strong>Templates &amp; Styles &rarr; Templates &rarr; <em>Select template</em> &rarr; Footer templates &rarr; Footer</strong> in your Admin Control Panel and then adding the following code:</p>
		<pre><code>Powered by &lt;a href=&quot;https://mybb.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;MyBB&lt;/a&gt;.</code></pre>

		<p>For ethical and legal reasons the MyBB Group does not provide support to websites violating the Project's <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/about/conduct/">Code of Conduct</a>.</p>
		<p>Websites hosting adult content (that is not generally illegal) are supported, however links and resources that may contain such material must be marked as "<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_safe_for_work">NSFW</a></i>".</p>

			<h1 class="block__heading__title">Support Denial</h1>
		</header>
		<p>Users that are found to violate the Support Eligibility Policy will be denied official support temporarily (for the first offense) until rectified, or permanently for repeated offenders.</p>
		<p>The support is denied on a per user basis, regardless of whether the support is intended for another acceptable site operated by the user. This is because otherwise MyBB staff can not be certain if their support is benefiting an acceptable site or one that is not.</p>

		<p>MyBB communication platforms are not the only source of support available for MyBB. You may be able to find an answer to your problem on the <a href="https://docs.mybb.com/">Docs site</a> or on another unofficial MyBB resource website.</p>
		<p>If you believe your support denial was unjustified, or you have rectified the issue that resulted in the denial, you may discuss the matter in the <a href="https://community.mybb.com/forum-135.html" title="Private Inquiries">Private Inquiries</a>, which may include removal of the support denial, at the sole judgment of the MyBB Group.</p>
